Total number of yearly visitors to Germantown metropark is calculated with +/-10% accuracy. Currently each 
entrance to the park is equipped with a traffic counter. The client states that it is expensive to maintain all 
the counters. As a cost-cutting measure, the client would like to remove some of the counters while still 
estimating the total visitors to the park with accuracy of the actual value of the yearly total.
